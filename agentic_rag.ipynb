This winningHindi-Marathi translation system is built based onNMT and evaluated based on the metric, BLEU.The domain-based data preprocessing and ﬁl-tering techniques eases model learning. Adoptingnovel approach of anonymizing language agnostictokens aided our system to focus more on tokensthat matters in the translation. It is highly observedthat the ratio of monolingual data used against bi-text data plays a vital role in back-translated mod-els. Improving translation accuracy and languageﬂuency by utilizing all available out-of-domainmonolingual corpora to the maximum effect can befurther explored.ReferencesDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Ben-gio. 2015.Neural machine translation by jointlylearning to align and translate.
