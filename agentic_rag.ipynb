One is back- translated model and the other model is trained on anonymized data. 1https:/github.com/kpu/preprocess\\n\\nProceedings of the 5th Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) , pages 437–441 Online, November 19–20, 2020. c⃝2020 Association for Computational Linguistics437Infosys Machine Translation System for WMT20 Similar Language Translation Task Kamalkumar Rathinasamy, Amanpreet Singh, Balaguru Sivasambagupta, Prajna Prasad Neerchal, Vani Sivasankaran Infosys Limited {kamalkumar r,amanpreet.singh04,balaguru.s,prajna.neerchal,vani.s }@infosys.com Abstract This paper describes Infosys’ submission to the WMT20 Similar Language Translation shared task. We participated in Indo-Aryan language pair in the language direction Hindi to Marathi. Our baseline system is byte- pair encoding based transformer model trained with the fairseq sequence modeling toolkit. Our ﬁnal system is an ensemble of two trans- former models, which ranked ﬁrst in the WMT20 evaluation. One model is designed to learn the nuances of translation of this low resource language pair by taking advantage of the fact that the source\\n\\nBLEU and ranked ﬁrst among all submissions. 5 Conclusion This paper describes the techniques involved in our system submitted for the WMT20 Similar Lan- guage Translation task by Infosys. This winning Hindi-Marathi translation system is built based on NMT and evaluated based on the metric, BLEU. The domain-based data preprocessing and ﬁl- tering techniques eases model learning. Adopting novel approach of anonymizing language agnostic tokens aided our system to focus more on tokens that matters in the translation. It is highly observed that the ratio of monolingual data used against bi- text data plays a vital role in back-translated mod- els. Improving translation accuracy and languageﬂuency by utilizing all available out-of-domain monolingual corpora to the maximum effect can be further explored.

If our goal is to train a Chinese-to-French translation model, for instance, we’d first train a model for French to Chinese and translate all of the monolingual French data to create synthetic, back-translated Chinese. Since the mined data can be used to train two directions of a given language pair (e.g., en->fr and fr->en), our mining strategy helps us effectively sparsely mine to best cover all 100×100 (a total of 9,900) directions in one model.\\n Related News\\nIntroducing SeamlessM4T, a Multimodal AI Model for Speech and Text Translations\\nTopics\\nFeatured News\\nFollow Us\\n© 2024 Meta\\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.
